## About

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for predicting the success of startups. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a startup's success based on various features and historical data.

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for startup data.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for startup success prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- A user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Git installed.
- (Optional) Virtual environment for a clean environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishint0001/StartupSuccess_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd StartupSuccess_Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the startup success prediction tool, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd StartupSuccess_Prediction
   ```

2. Run the CLI:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to input startup information and predict the likelihood of success.
